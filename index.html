            An enigmatic treasure trove of almost unimaginable archaeological
            and cultural riches, it's hard not to think of Egypt without
            imagining the Sphinx, the pyramids at Giza, Luxor, the Valley of the
            Kings and the Nile. As well as being the world's largest open-air
            museum, Egypt also offers a slew of luxurious Red Sea resorts, many
            within reach of spectacular snorkeling, diving and windsurfing.
            Whether you see it by riverboat, from camelback or from just above
            the coral, Egypt's sights are unforgettable.
